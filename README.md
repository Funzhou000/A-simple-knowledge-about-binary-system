#Today I Learned About Operators, But It’s Still Hard to Understand
I realized that my difficulty might stem from a lack of comprehensive understanding of binary numbers, so I studied related content on Bilibili. (I think the book “Introduction to Computer Science” might also cover this topic, I’ll update after reading it next time.)

Bits and Bytes A bit is the smallest unit of storage in a computer. A bit can only store a 0 or a 1. Eight bits make up a byte. In ASCII encoding, one English letter occupies one byte. In UTF-8 encoding, one Chinese character usually occupies 3 bytes, but it can also be 2 to 4 bytes.
The Relationship Between Bits and Computer Fundamentals In computers, transistors have only two signals: on and off. These states are represented by 1 and 0, respectively.
A Simple Example of Binary in Computers The range of each primary color in RGB is 0-255 because the largest integer that can be represented by one byte is 255 (2^8 - 1).
